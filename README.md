Since our platform uses an AI model at the backend to generate outputs, we are currently unable to deploy it online due to limited free credits.  

### Here's how you can run it locally:
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yashi2606/Fintech.git

# 2. Go into the project folder
cd Fintech

# 3. Navigate to the API directory
cd api

# 4. Run the backend server
python models_server.py

# 5. Open index.html in the root folder with Live Server (in VSCode)
#    - Right click on index.html
#    - Click "Open with Live Server"
